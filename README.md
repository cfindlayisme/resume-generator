# resume-generator

WIP

- Whole point of this is to take my resume with lots of information, combined with a job description, and generate a resume that is tailored to that job description.
- Might later on add a quick cover letter option as well.
- Will likely turn into an API way of running this.
- Created as a combination of lazyness at writing these things myself and proving I do know how to use LLMs for something useful.
